# 🏥 **HealthData IQ – Hospital Insights & Patient Analytics**   
### 📝**Overview**  
HealthData IQ is a comprehensive data analytics project focused on extracting meaningful insights from U.S. hospital data. It explores hospital performance, patient satisfaction, quality scores, accessibility, and healthcare outcomes using Python, SQL, and visualization techniques. This project aims to assist healthcare stakeholders in data-driven decision-making through interactive visuals and statistical insights.

### 🧹**Data Cleaning**  
- Data cleaning was performed using Pandas in Python.     
**Key steps included:**  

- Removing duplicates and missing/null values.  

- Standardizing column formats (e.g., converting date/time, proper naming).    

- Correcting data types (e.g., strings to integers/floats).  

- Calculating new features like quality score, patient rating score, etc.  

### **📊 Exploratory Data Analysis & Statistics**  
**Key analyses and methods applied:**  

- Distribution Analysis – Using normal distribution histograms, skewness, and kurtosis.   

- Correlation Analysis – Between hospital ratings, patient satisfaction, and quality scores.  

- Grouped Insights – By hospital type, ownership, and state.  

- Visualizations – Using Matplotlib, Seaborn for insightful graphs.  

## **🧠 SQL Integration (Planned/Future)**   

- Top-rated hospitals by state.  

- Average quality scores by hospital ownership.  

- States with highest patient satisfaction.  

- Hospitals with highest readmission or mortality rates.  



📌 Key Features  
✔️ End-to-end data cleaning using Pandas  
✔️ Visualizations for trends, patterns, and anomalies  
✔️ Statistical summaries with skewness/kurtosis interpretation  
✔️ Correlation matrix to understand variable relationships  
✔️ Analysis segmented by state, ownership, and type  
✔️ Ready for SQL dashboard or Power BI integration  

## 🔧**Installation & Setup**
**Required Libraries**  
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy  

🔮**Future Improvements**  
📈 Power BI dashboard for real-time interactive exploration

🧮**Predictive analytics using ML (e.g., hospital rating prediction)**

📡 **SQL database connection for live data querying**
